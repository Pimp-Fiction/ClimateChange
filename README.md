# Climate Change ðŸŒŽ
Climate change is one of the most controversial topics of the 21st century! Climate change describes a change in the average conditions â€” such as temperature and rainfall â€” in a region over a long period of time. 
<p> Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented increases in temperature at Earthâ€™s surface, as well as in the atmosphere and oceans. Many other aspects of global climate are changing as well. Human activities, especially emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and land-use change, are the primary driver of the climate changes observed in the industrial era.
<p> Climate change fatalities are generally linked to four different catalysts: Rising temperatures, Declining air quality, Extreme weather and Vector-borne illnesses.
<p> In this Project Shrey Mehta and I have taken climate change data to visualize the temerature variation through Exploratory Data Analysis using R studio.

<h3> ðŸ‘‰ Preparing Data: </h3><br>
  This data is chosen from https://www.kaggle.com/vageeshabudanur/riseintemp-dataset
  <ul>
<li>Year: the observation year,</li><br>
<li>Month: the observation month,</li><br>
<li>MEI: multivariate El Nino Southern Oscillation index (MEI), a measure of the strength of the El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation (a weather effect in the Pacific Ocean that affects global temperatures),</li><br>
<li>CO2: atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide,</li><br>
<li>CH4: atmospheric concentrations of methane,</li><br>
<li>N2O: atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide,</li><br>
<li>CFC-11: atmospheric concentrations of trichlorofluoromethane,</li><br>
<li>CFC-12: atmospheric concentrations of dichlorodifluoromethane,</li><br>
<li>TSI: the total solar irradiance (TSI) in W/m2 (the rate at which the sunâ€™s energy is deposited per unit area). Due to sunspots and other solar phenomena, the amount of energy that is given off by the sun varies substantially with time,</li><br>
<li>Aerosols: the mean stratospheric aerosol optical depth at 550 nm. This variable is linked to volcanoes, as volcanic eruptions result in new particles being added to the atmosphere, which affect how much of the sunâ€™s energy is reflected back into space,</li><br>
<li>Temp: the difference in degrees Celsius between the average global temperature in that period and a reference value.</li><br>
  </ul>

Note:<br>
CO<Sub>2</sub>,N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>:Expressed in ppmv<br>
CFC.11 and CFC.12: Expressed in ppbv

<h3>ðŸ‘‰ Exploratory Data Anlysis (EDA)</h3><br>
A few plots based on the code base written have been added to the repository.
