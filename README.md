# Climate Change ðŸŒŽ
Climate change is one of the most controversial topics of the 21st century! Climate change describes a change in the average conditions â€” such as temperature and rainfall â€” in a region over a long period of time. 
Thousands of studies conducted by researchers around the world have documented increases in temperature at Earthâ€™s surface, as well as in the atmosphere and oceans. Many other aspects of global climate are changing as well. Human activities, especially emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and land-use change, are the primary driver of the climate changes observed in the industrial era.
Climate change fatalities are generally linked to four different catalysts: Rising temperatures, Declining air quality, Extreme weather and Vector-borne illnesses.
